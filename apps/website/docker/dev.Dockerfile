# Manifests first so a source-only change reuses the install layer. Scripts are

# tree over /repo at runtime, so anything built now would be shadowed anyway.
# The build happens in CMD instead, against the mounted sources.

# pg-js is built at start, not baked in, for two reasons: `packages/pg-js/dist`
# is gitignored so a fresh clone has none, and the bind mount would shadow an
# image-built copy regardless. Without it the dev server boots and `/` is 200,
# but the site's `@e4a/pg-js` import 500s — the package resolves through
# `exports: {".": "./dist/index.mjs"}`, which does not exist yet.
#
# No `--` before `--host`: pnpm forwards the separator verbatim, vite reads it
# as end-of-options, and the flag is silently dropped — leaving vite on
# 127.0.0.1 inside the container and nginx's proxy_pass getting refused.
