/**
 * What this repo's required checks are actually wired to (postguard-js#222).
 *
 * `main` pins twenty contexts by DISPLAY NAME, spread over seven of the eight
 * workflow files here (every one but `delivery.yml`), and until this file existed
 * nothing in the repo read any of those names. That is the
 * encryption4all/postguard#299 vector twenty times over: branch protection
 * matches a required check by its name, so renaming a job does not break its
 * gate — it silently
 * *disarms* it, leaving a context that no job produces.
 *
 * Where the twenty live is worth measuring rather than assuming, because it is
 * not where the sibling repo keeps its one. Classic protection here requires **no
 * status checks at all** — only one approving review, with `enforce_admins:
 * false`. All twenty come from the ruleset `main` (id 14326269), and that ruleset
 * grants the `developers` team `bypass_mode: always`, so for anyone on that team
 * every one of them is advisory. That does not weaken the case for this file, it
 * is the case for it: a test runs on its own merits whether or not the
 * enforcement behind it binds.
 *
 * A second vector is specific to this repo. `Integration complete` is an
 * aggregate whose coverage is exactly its `needs:` list, and the workflow said
 * so in a comment — "Adding a lane above? Add it to `needs` here too, or it is
 * not covered by the required check no matter how loudly it fails". A comment
 * is a convention. "the aggregate covers every lane in the file" below derives
 * that set from the file instead, so a lane added and not covered fails here
 * rather than running, reporting, and counting for nothing.
 *
 * ## Where this lives, and why it cannot be skipped by what it catches
 *
 * `pg-core/tests/ci_wiring.rs` in the sibling repo had to dodge a path filter:
 * the gate it guards runs its own tests, so a guard beside the gate is deleted
 * along with it. Here the shape is different. **No workflow in this repo is
 * path-filtered** — every one of them says so in a header comment, deliberately,
 * because the point of the monorepo is that an SDK change is tested against its
 * consumers in the same PR. So "which lane is unconditional" has the answer
 * "all of them", and the real question is which lane this file is a hostage of.
 *
 * It lives in `packages/pg-js`, whose vitest suite runs in three separate lanes
 * of `integration.yml` — `Node 22`/`Node 24` (via `pnpm -r test`), `Bun 1.3.14`
 * and `Deno 2.8.0`. Consequences worth keeping:
 *
 * - It is in a different *file* from six of the seven workflows that carry a
 *   required context — `website.yml`, `outlook-addon.yml`, `tb-addon.yml`,
 *   `pr-title.yml`, `examples.yml` and `sdk-canary.yml`, all but
 *   `integration.yml` — so a job renamed or deleted in any of those cannot skip
 *   its own guard. A guard living in `apps/website` would be run by `Svelte
 *   Check`'s workflow, which is exactly the file whose renames it is supposed to
 *   notice.
 * - No single lane deletion silences it, because three lanes run it.
 * - It is not run by the aggregate itself, so `Integration complete` losing a
 *   `needs` entry still turns something red.
 *
 * What that placement does *not* cover: removing all three SDK lanes from
 * `needs` in one change would leave this file red in jobs nothing requires. The
 * guard still fails loudly and visibly — the point of the map is silent drift,
 * and that is not silent — but it is `Envelope compatibility` and `API surface`,
 * required by name in their own right, that would still block.
 *
 * ## What no test can reach
 *
 * That the ruleset still lists these contexts, and who may still bypass them,
 * lives in GitHub's API:
 *
 *     gh api repos/encryption4all/postguard-js/rules/branches/main
 *
 * No test runner can call it. `REQUIRED_CONTEXTS` below is this side of that
 * link; keep the two in step, and when you rename a job, rename the context in
 * the same change.
 *
 * ## On reading YAML as text
 *
 * There is no YAML parser in this workspace and this needs none: the assertions
 * are about literal names and literal commands. The reader detects the file's
 * indent rather than assuming it, and throws when it finds no jobs — a reformat
 * that defeats it fails here loudly instead of quietly asserting nothing.
