// Pure comparison core for the ruleset-drift checker (postguard-js#274). No
// network, no fs — see ../ruleset-drift.mjs for the thin CLI that reads
// .github/required-rules.json, fetches the live ruleset, and calls
// `compareRules` below, and ../../tests/ruleset-drift.test.ts for the offline
// self-test that exercises it with hand-written fixtures.
//
// Exit contract, mirrored by the CLI and by scripts/ruleset-drift.sh in
// encryption4all/postguard:
//
//   0  the live rules require exactly the expected contexts and at least the
//      expected review count
//   1  DRIFT: a context is missing or unexpectedly present, or the review
//      count is lower than expected
//   2  UNDETERMINED: the live rules could not be read or made no sense — the
//      API was unreachable, answered non-200, or the parsed body isn't the
//      shape a rules-branches-main response takes. NOT drift: reporting this
//      as 1 would send someone to edit a ruleset that is probably correct,
//      and reporting real drift as this would hide a real hole.
